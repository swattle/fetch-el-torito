Perl script which will extract the initial/default boot image from a CD if existent. It'll not extract any of other possibly existing boot images that are allowed by the El Torito standard.

The image data are written to STDOUT. All other information is written to
STDERR (Eg. Type and size of image). <br />
If you want to write the image to a file instead of STDOUT, you can
specify the filename wanted on the command-line using option -o <filename>

Call: 	 fetcheltorito CD-image > toritoimagefile <br />
Example: fetcheltorito /dev/sr0  > /tmp/bootimage
